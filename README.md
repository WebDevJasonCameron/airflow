# Apache Airflow Study

## 2022 08 06 | The Start
I started this training a few days ago.  I wasn't sure if it warranted a repo.  However, I think there are a lot of lessons I want to capture.  This repo will maintain my work as I first work through a Udemy course, "The Complete Hands-On Introduction to Apache Airflow" by Marc Lamberti.
